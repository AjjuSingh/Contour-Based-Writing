I am adding a new feature here on the existing project so it will be a very great idea to understand the working mechanism of the existing system.

    "Now i want to try something new here. <b> As for writing this blog, i have not done any coding on this topic but if you read further you might be able to know what did i accomplish throughout the end.</b> I want the system to run without the need of keyboard(i am just assuming here). \n",

    "How i got the idea to perform this project? I don't know but something like, \"Once i was writing something on my paper and then ink on the pen finished, and i was not able to write more because i had no spare pens. Also shop is far from village. Then i got an idea, can i replace the pen just for some moments?\" Well it is just a funny story. But truth is, me and my friend was about to do some academic research. We have to think many topics and one of mine choice is here. This topic is rejected so i am here, to make it work."

It will not be a real GUI but it will be shown on some side of the frame. We will move our finger to those part and we can actually perform some tasks. While writing this, i have not proceeded towards code so lets see where the boat takes. \n",

So to make icons, i am going to work on paint. Make a black background and draw icons on it. As always black color is identity additive on Image Processing world so lets get into it. I am making an folder named `Icons` on working directory and saving all icons there. The image will be 301 by 299 dimension PNG image (originally was trying to make (300, 300) but paint betrayed me).\n",

    "### Running Averages\n",
    "Since we are dealing with two different ROIs from different portion of an frame, we definitely need 2 averages for respective ROIs. For drawing, variable names are either started with `d` or `draw` and for VUI, variable name started with `g` or `gui`. For example, for grayscale draw, `draw_gray`. So the current code inside `run_system`'s taking average part looks like below:\n",

    "### Getting Contours from VUI\n",
    "As usual, we pass our backgroud (averaged) image and then the grayscale current ROI, and take the absolute difference inside method `get_contours`. What is new here is that we are performing two `get_contours` because we have 2 ROIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we took contours for VUI by passing `gui_bg` and `gui_gray` to `get_contours` then we did same for `draw`. Then we proceed to check if contours were present on VUI regions. Same as previous code we took contour's extreme position (for drawing, minimum was taken). Then we have to find that on which box was the contour detected. Since each box on VUI ROI has distinctive purpose, it is very necessary to calculate it properly. So to make is more precise, i came up with an idea. If same mode occurs on more than curtain times then work on this mode else don't change the mode. For simplicity i am checking on 5 consecutive frames only.\n",
